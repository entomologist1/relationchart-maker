# relationchart-maker
 
i didnt want to copy and paste 100000 accordion divs bc it was too confusing. so now its like this. 

these are the og files not on neocities. i had to add some stuff to make it fit into the website and its a fucking mess. i blame 2022 me idk what i was trying to do with the navbar. so if u look at the stylesheet over there        um just ignore it 

- when assigning relations, blue is the origin, while pink is the recipient. any relations submitted will be under blue's tab unless you choose two-way. click on the blue selection to deselect the origin and choose another one
- click to select origin/recipient. reorder by dragging things around. submit/delete/edit in the little box then click on export as html when ur done
- i hate accordions i hate accordions i hate accordions
